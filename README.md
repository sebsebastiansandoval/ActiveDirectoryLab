<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this tutorial we are going to learn the step-by-step process of creating an Active Directory Home Lab environment using Oracle Virtual Box. By following this lab it will definitely help develop your understanding of active directory and how Windows networking works, so I'd recommend going through it at least a couple times. Make sure to ask questions where you don't understand and even consider asking ChatGPT about any unfimiliar concepts until they make sense. Eventually try this lab without using the tutorial as well. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
